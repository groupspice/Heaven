Designed to highlight  ve purposes for successful small groups: fellowship, discipleship, ministry, evangelism, and worship, this discussion guide includes 7 sessions, FAQs, Re ection pages, leader notes, and other group suggestions.  e DVD includes 7 video sessions taught by Randy Alcorn, small group leader tips, worship songs, leader notes, and bonus footage. e group discussion sessions and Re ections in this discussion guide coincide with Randy Alcorn’s book 50 Days of Heaven (a compilation of the best of the book Heaven). We recommend each group member purchase the 50 Days of Heaven book. In addition, if you want to use the companion Heaven DVD during your study, group leaders will need to purchase a copy of the Heaven book containing the DVD. We have cross-referenced the Heaven book to the questions in this discussion guide for your reference.A typical group session will include the following:MEMORY VERSE. For each session we have provided a memory verse that emphasizes an important truth. Memorizing this verse is optional, but we believe that memorizing Scripture can be a vital part of renewing and transforming our minds according to the will of God. We encourage you to give this important habit a try.CONNECTING WITH GOD’S FAMILY.  e foundation for spiritual growth is an intimate connection with God and his family. A few people who really know you and who earn your trust provide a place to experience the life Jesus invites you to live.  is section of each session typically o ers you an opportunity to get to know your whole group using an icebreaker question.DVD TEACHING SEGMENT. A DVD companion to this discussion guide is available. For each study session, the DVD contains a message by Randy Alcorn.

We want to help you understand and apply the Scriptures practically and creatively, allowing God to transform your life from the inside out through the application of God’s timeless truths.DEVELOPING AND SHARING SECTIONS. Each session will include one of the following sections:DEVELOPING YOUR GIFTS TO SERVE OTHERS. God has designed each of us uniquely to serve him in a way no other person can. Some group sessions will focus on helping you discover and use your God-given abilities.SHARING YOUR LIFE MISSION EVERY DAY. Jesus wants all of his disciples to help outsiders connect with him, to know him personally. Some group sessions will encourage you to go beyond Bible study to biblical living.PRAYER AND SURRENDER. God is most pleased by a heart that is fully his. Some group sessions will give you a chance to surrender your heart to God in worship. You may read a Psalm, share the Lord’s Supper, or sing a song together to close your meeting.  is time will knit your hearts in community and help you surrender your hurts and dreams into the hands of the One who knows you best.SCRIPTURE STUDY. If you want to dig deeper into the Bible passages about the subject at hand, we’ve provided suggested study passages in this section.  e Growing section will provide you with plenty to discuss within the group, so we recommend that participants study these passages on their own between group meetings, if desired.REFLECTIONS. We encourage you to read seven Re ections, one each day, between small group meetings.  e suggested Re ections and space for journaling each week are listed at the end of each session.

Our prayer for you is to experience the reality of God in a way that really begins to transform your everyday life. God created each of us for a life that is far better than we ever imagined possible, and we want to do all that we can to embrace what He has for us.As you join us on this journey, we hope you will personally encounter God in a profound way. And as you learn and grow, we hope you will share with others what you are learning. We are very excited that you have decided to join us in this study of Heaven.In the video for this study on Heaven, Randy Alcorn discusses a renewed perspective of Heaven based on the reality of the present Heaven, the restoration promised in a New Earth, and the rewards of reigning and ruling with God on the New Earth, Eden reclaimed. ere are three phases: life on earth as we now know it, an Intermediate Heaven—the place we go when we die, and the New Heaven and New Earth we will inhabit a er the resurrection.  ese three phases are depicted in the timeline below.6]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[SESSION 1: WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HEAVENMemory Verse: And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down  om God out of heaven like a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. 3I heard a loud shout  om the throne, saying, “Look, God’s home is now among his people! He will live with them, and they will be his people. God himself will be with them.” Revelation 21:2–3 (NLT)Many people don’t look forward to Heaven because it is a realm that we lack the ability to see or easily understand. We are naturally hesitant or even fearful in uncertain situations.  is session will give us perspective on what Heaven is like.We have included Reflections at the end of each session that correlate to Randy Alcorn’s 50 Days of Heaven book. We suggest you read the Introduction and Days 1 through 7 in the book as you work through the Re ections, one each day, before each group meeting. We have provided space at the end of each Re ection where you can write your thoughts. These pages are for personal re ection that will not be shared during group time.If you don’t have time to work through all the Re ections before the next group meeting, we suggest you work through the day(s) marked with an asterisk.Open your group with prayer.Group ValuesAttendance. Give priority to the group meeting. Call or email if you will be late or absent.Environment. Help create a safe place where people can be heard and feel loved. (No quick answers, snap judgments, or simple  xes.)Respect. Be gentle and gracious— people have di erent spiritual maturity, personal opinions, and temperaments. Remember, we are all works in progress.Con dentiality. Keep everything that is shared in the group strictly con dential—no exceptions.Welcome Newcomers. Keep an open chair and share Jesus’ dream of  nding a shepherd for every sheep.Group Ownership. Remember that every member is a minister. Each group member should take on a small role or responsibility in the group over time.7]]></text>

Randy desires to give us purpose, perspective, and hope as we look forward to eternity in a real, tangible Heaven.5. Based on the video teaching, how has your perspective of Heaven changed?Identify and discuss some of the misconceptions people have about Heaven. (Heaven, pp. 5–13)6. In Isaiah 65:17a God says Behold, I will create new heavens and a new earth (NIV).How does this verse help you see Heaven as a real place? What do you think the New Earth will look like?

One of the criminals cruci ed with Jesus said to him, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.” 43Jesus answered him, “I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in Paradise.” Luke 23:42b–43 (NIV)Where is Jesus now according to this verse? What does this say about where believers currently go when they die?8. One of the biggest misconceptions is that the current Heaven, or Paradise, is our  nal destination when we die.Read Revelation 21:2–3 and discuss where God will ultimately dwell with humankind. (Heaven, pp. 41–42)We tend to picture the permanent Heaven rather than the temporary one. How does the dwelling place described in Revelation 21:2–3 di er from most people’s understanding of Heaven?9. A New Jerusalem, on the New Earth, will be the dwelling place of all God’s children a er the Resurrection (see the timeline in the Introduction.)

Like the apostle Paul, we are encouraged to forget what is behind and press on toward the goal to win the prize.Use the space included for each day to write down any thoughts or feelings that God is putting on your heart.No, dear brothers and sisters, I am still not all I should be, but I am focusing all my energies on this one thing: Forgetting the past and looking forward to what lies ahead, 14I strain to reach the end of the race and receive the prize for which God, through Christ Jesus, is calling us up to heaven.

        <text><![CDATA[FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSWhat do we do on the first night of our group?Like all fun things in life–have a party! A “get to know you” coffee, dinner, or dessert is a great way to launch a new study. You may want to review the Group Values (page 9) and share the names of a few friends you can invite to join you. But most importantly, have fun before your study time begins.Where do we find new members for our group?This can be troubling, especially for new groups that have only a few people or for existing groups that lose a few people along the way. We encourage you to pray with your group and then brainstorm a list of people from work, church, your neighborhood, your children’s school, family, the gym, and so forth. Then have each group member invite several of the people on his or her list. Another good strategy is to ask church leaders to make an announcement or allow a bulletin insert.No matter how you find members, it’s vital that you stay on the lookout for new people to join your group. All groups tend to go through healthy attrition—the result of moves, releasing new leaders, ministry opportunities, and so forth—and if the group gets too small, it could be at risk of shutting down. If you and your group stay open, you’ll be amazed at the people God sends your way. The next person just might become a friend for life. You never know!How long will this group meet?It’s totally up to the group—once you come to the end of this study. Most groups meet weekly for at least their first several weeks, but every other week can work as well. We strongly recommend that the group meet for the first six months on a weekly basis if at all possible. This allows for continuity, and if people miss a meeting they aren’t gone for a whole month.At the end of this study, each group member may decide if he or she wants to continue on for another study. Some groups launch relationships for years to come, and others are stepping-stones into another group experience. Either way, enjoy the journey.106]]></text>

If we ignore the inner cry for intimate communication with God, we become hard of hearing, unable to recognize his voice when He speaks to us.”Terry’s music is designed to direct the listener to an intimate relationship with their Heavenly Father.Terry and his wife, Nancy, continue to produce music projects and live worship and teaching events focused on the core of Christianity—an intimate relationship with God.
